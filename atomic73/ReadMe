This data set was created in 2012, and many of the changes over the Standard39 set that NSH started out with was to try and improve agreement of ioinzation state between Cloudy and Python. Comments below are always differences between files here and those which came with standard39


atomic/atomic73/elem_ions_ver_73.py - This file differs from the file in 39 mainly because the multiplicity of the bare ions has been corrected to 1 from the original which was 2
atomic/atomic73/topbase_levels_h.py - More levels have been included from topbase, and the file levels_hhe file split into two.
atomic/atomic73/topbase_levels_he.py - As above
atomic/atomic73/topbase_levels_cno.py - Same
atomic/atomic73/topbase_levels_fe.py - Added
atomic/atomic73/levels_ver_2.py - In 39, an error in the parse routine meant that many levels were missing. This is fixed
atomic/atomic73/lines_linked_ver_2.py - As above
atomic/atomic73/excited.py - Same
atomic/atomic73/recomb.data - Same data as in 39, but all ions included - many were commented out in the 39 data set, which led to odd behaviour if you included ions than were missing the data. NB, this data is mainly redundant since in python73 and onwards, the recombination to GS fraction is computed from the total and gs rates read in below.
atomic/atomic73/topbase_h1_phot.py - More data included
atomic/atomic73/topbase_he1_phot.py - Unchanged
atomic/atomic73/topbase_he2_phot.py - Unchanged
atomic/atomic73/topbase_cno_phot.py - Unchanged
atomic/atomic73/topbase_fe_phot.py - Added 
atomic/atomic73/photo_fkvy.data - Unchanged
atomic/atomic73/coll.data - Unchanged
