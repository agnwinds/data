The files in this directory are an attempt to recreate the files used by NSH in his regression testing work in Winter 11/12. Some changes were made to the standard39 files.
Note that the dielectronic recombination data was, for a while, read in from this file:

clist_K.txt

using this file in py74b doesnt work, it requires the Badnell type data.
