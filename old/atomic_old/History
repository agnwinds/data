SS July 2004
------------

I've cleaned up the atomic directory so that now (26 July 04) it contains only
those atomic data sets that (as far as I understand) are likely to be in use
currently or in the near future. These are:

standard39
kurucz39
h20   - a twenty level macro atom hydrogen model (for YSO calculations)
h20_he20 - a combined macro atom model of hydrogen and helium
h20_standard39 - combined h20 and standard39
h20_he20_standard39 - combinaed h20, he20 and standard39

All the other files that were here before are currently in the subdirectory
old/ in case we want any of them (or in case I've missed something important).

I've checked that all six sets of atomic data in this directory do run (at
least for the current regression yso model).
