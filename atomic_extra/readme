coll.dat : This is collisional data for line excitation - superceeded by ver_upsilon.dat

elem_ions_ver_80_z002 : A version of elemental abundances suitable for 10% solar

elem_ions_ver_sn.dat : A version of the elemental abundances file used in the sn_1d examples file - my have serious errors

kaastra_fluorescent_yield.dat : fluosrescent yields for auger ionization - it is ntended to use this data at some point - currently python cannot process it

levels_kur.dat / lines_linked_kur.dat : These are lines and assocuated levels for the kurukz line list - only referred to in standard_sn_kurukz file - but used in one of our regression tests.
